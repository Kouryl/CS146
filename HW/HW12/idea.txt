To get the min cost, using greedy approach. It requires MST and a min heap. 
First add all pipes to a min heap (sorted by the pipe cost), 
Create a visited list to keep track of house visited to prevent extra costs
While queue isn't empty just check if both houses on the pipes are visited, if not, then
We can add to the min cost, else just drop it. 
After that just added the lowest well cost to the min we have and return.

* Didn't know if we had to implement our own heaps though, but because I was lazy
I just imported priorityqueue,
