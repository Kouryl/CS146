The question ask us to tell if we can complete the courses, not give an order to finish all courses. 
So I initialize all in degrees with 0, go through the pre-req array and increment the in degrees. 

Then again by decrementing outgoings.

Then I use the pre-req array to check if the requirements have an in degree, if so, we can't finish.

Basically kahn's algorithm or similar.
